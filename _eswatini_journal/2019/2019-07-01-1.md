Today is still considered our day off so in the morning we visited the Mantenga Cultural Village in eSwatini. I really enjoyed our tour around the campgrounds because we learned a lot about their cultural background and history. After the tour, the wedding dance at the end was spectacular as well. The performers were very enthusiastic and their harmonizing vocals were breathtaking. We were also lucky enough to reunite with a couple of Taiwan tourists that we met at the airport and we enjoyed the show together. 

In the afternoon, we visited the Mbabane Government Hospital. It is the biggest public hospital in eSwatini and Taiwan Medical Mission is based here as well. We had a tour of the building and how the hospital was divided. We were able to visit most of the facility and I was very saddened by the conditions of the hospital. There were only 2 rooms for operations and 5 beds for ICU. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do to help because that is outside of our reach; however, we still tried our best to make a change by donating 155 binders. Unfortunately, we did not meet their expectations because they wanted us to label our binders to help them organize. We took photos of what they wanted and hopefully in the future we will not make the same mistakes again and provide better service to anyone in need. In a couple days, we will also headout with the Taipei Medical Mission team to rural villages to provide free check ups and hopefully we are able to make a difference and help the ones in need.
