Today, Mangana, one of our Swazi students, who cooperates with us, brought us to his community. We had our health education with rural health motivators. It was great to see the people who are paying attention with our teaching. We really hope they will help their neighborhoods after having our first aid kits, as well as the basic hygiene knowledge that we had taught them.

We also built two rocket stoves in two houses. It was our first rocket stove today, so we were still quite unsure the portion of the mixture of cement, or the texture. Luckily, we had the Babe of the house to help us, although he looked quite impatient as we built, probably we were still unskilled. The reason we build rocket stove is to prevent smoke to spread out which will cause respiratory disease, besides that, make sure the fire can combust stronger and faster.
