Today was thrilling and interesting day. Today was our first day off so we went to Sibebe to hike. Today the weather was nice and sunny perfect for hiking. I remember I was the first one following behind the tour guide but half way through I stopped and I was exhausted. I suddenly ended up near the end of the group. We were able to catch up because people started taking pictures and I rested for a couple minutes and started taking pictures too.

We had to come down earlier than expected because there was too much smoke. We also stopped by the Swazi Candle to buy souvenirs. Everything was beautiful there but I wanted to wait till the next time I visit to buy because I wanted to see all the souvenirs before buying it so I can compare prices. After we got home, there was no electricity so we had to go out to eat and we went to Mbabane for dinner. I had Spur, and American diner, and it was amazing I would definitely go back again. They also had burgers buy one get one free so I might go back again on Monday to try it.
