The reading project of TFCF is the one we are most interested in, so I asked Su if we can join them. We had printed a poster of the world map in Taiwan, and let everyone prepared a introduction of each country. Today, there are 18 children who are appropriately 10 years old. Firstly, we introduce them the continents and oceans; Next, our members introduce some countries, including Taiwan, China, Brazil, Italy, Egypt, Australia, Mexico, America, etc; Lastly, we let the children draw what they think standing for eSwatini, and let them share what they have drawn. Most of them draw mountains and people here, while only a few of them draw soccer or animals.

Although we don’t actually know what they think of our activities, I see smile on their face, I think they do enjoy it. Thanks to Smally, who helps us to translate. He says he is quite enjoy with the activity too.
