Today we went to Cyril’s community.

In this April, we went to I-Shou university, and held a welcome party there. Fortunately, some of them decided to join us in this July, and Cyril is one of these kind people.

I think today is not a tiring day, since we only gave them health education. After that, we distributed first aid kits to the teachers. To my surprise, they asked us if we can give them some computers for the technology class. However, we can’t donate them these things, so we promised them if we know any organization which are doing this, we would let them know the information.

In the afternoon, we visit FLAS (the Family Life Association of eSwatini). They told us some statistics about relationships between the sexes. Their fist sexual intercourse happen in 15-19 years old in average, which I can’t imagine what it will be like. Besides, 27% of their pregnant women are teenagers.

Therefore, they have mobile clinics and stations for the youth. Although I don’t really know what they are actually doing, I think what they want to do for the society has touched me. 

I hope that in the future, we can cooperate with them, and have some new projects on this topic or issue.
