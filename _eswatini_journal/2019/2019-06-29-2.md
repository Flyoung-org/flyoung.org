We are finally here in eSwatini after a long time of preparation and a long journey from Taiwan. The journey from Taiwan to eSwatini took us about one and a half day. Unfortunately, EVAAIR had a strike which our flight had been canceled that we needed to change the flight immediately one week before our flight. Hence, we needed to wait for about 8 hours for transiting in Hong Kong Airport after changing the new flight. The transit time was really bored that we have nothing to do but just keep surfing the internet.

Though the duration for transportation took us a long time which made us extremely exhausted, we do enjoy the scenery in Africa which really different from our country. We were so lucky that we saw many animals such as ostrich, rhino, impala, and zebra when we purchasing our meal at the resting stop on the way to the eSwatini.

The people here are nice that they greet us and talk to us friendly. Since the red color of our teams’ clothing is really eye-catching, many of the locals were curious about us. Many of us were shock when some strangers proposed to the girls in our team. In eSwatini, the men can ask any women that they first met to marry him. It was really a culture shock as we do not have any experience like this in our country.

We are looking forward to the experience in eSwatini this month. We wish that everything will go smoothly and hope that our projects can bring some changes to their life.
