Unconsciously, the team has passed a week, and today is a rare day off.

In the morning, after breakfast, we went to Gables for a pleasant day trip. There are malls, restaurants, cinemas, clothing stores, drugstores, etc., which are enough for us to visit the whole afternoon. Some members went to the movies, and I bought some daily necessities.

Today is Monday, Spur Steak Ranches has an event to choose one of Hamburg's second free hospitality. So we had a good meal for lunch.

The evening life group cooked a full table of home cooking, very delicious.

Today is like the name of my Eswatini, not only a sunny day, but also have a good day！
