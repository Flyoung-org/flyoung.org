We started today’s schedule at 8:30 am. We drove for an hour on tarred road. And one of our car’s tire punctured. Drivers in eSwatini have to know how to change tire theirself because I don’t think there will be anyone to save you. Our two drivers took 5 minutes to change the tire which made our team very amazed. (Since none of us have that skill.) Then it became road made in rocks and sand, how lucky that our car can also drive through shallow water cause we also have to went through it. When we finally get to the spot showed in google map, there are no school! We called to double check the location and it turns out the preschool is on another hilltop. So we drove through the bumpy road again to get to the hill. 

When we arrived at Madacaza preschool founded by SHAMBA, it’s already their lunch time. Their teachers gathered the students indoor and we started our winter camp program. We counted the fish and taught the correct way to brush teeth. Then we taught them six categories of food and played the game related. What is very touching is that the two teacher were so energetic and they showed so much effort trying to record everything we taught. They even take notes. By observing the decoration and educating poster in the classroom, you can see that SHAMBA is a NGO that is really thoughtful for the students. (They’ve got toothbrushes and water bottles for every student.)

After the class we played with them in their playground. It was a nice experience and I hope the kids there can all have a bright future.
