Today we went to a school (M.P.S.) with TMM. Departed at 6:45, we picked up 2 college students who study in Taiwan. One of them called Siphelele, and she did brushing & tinea capitis health education with my group. For there are 1-7 grades in the school, we did the same education 9 rounds. The students were all enthusiastic.

At noon we got lunchboxes from the drivers. More and more students gathered around the classroom at the same time. They all asked for food or money. Unfortunately, all of our bottled water were stolen when we aren’t in the classroom.

After eating, some girl students came to our classroom and flirted with some of the boys of our team. They even had the college students play the songs and danced. They didn’t leave until we get out of the classroom.

After all, boy students were much more kinder than girls. One of them even helped us clean the spoiled coke. And all of them brought their textbook and share the contents with us.

Next we went to eat pizza with members of TMM and the cooperated university students. The drivers were also with us. We were all full, both body and gratefulness.
