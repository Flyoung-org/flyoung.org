We worked with Taiwan Fund For Children and Families to educate adolescents . We divided into two group. Some of us educate the adolescents with sex issues, and the others educate about sport injuries.

First, let’s talk about the education of sport injury. We went with the soccer team and played ice-breaking games about knowing other’s names. It’s really interesting and fun which made everyone know each other better. Then, we started warming up and training. We found out that they really started to call others names. In the end, we demonstrated how to protect ourselves and how to use first aid kits when we face sport injuries. Hope they could use them practically in the futures.

As for the sex issues education, we talked about the relationship between different genders, HIV and AIDS, how to use condoms and so on. We played some easy games to let them learn it in an interesting way. 

In the next hour, we taught them about diabetes. We chose this topic because diabetes rated the 4th of the most diseases people got here. We told them how dangerous diabetes are and how to prevent it. After then, we played a card game about diabetes with them. It turned out to be that the card games were a little bit too complicated for them but they still marked that they learned a lot of knowledge about diabetes.

Working with TFCF was a very interesting and fabulous experience. We not only learned the culture difference by discussing with them but also realized what we can do more to help them.
