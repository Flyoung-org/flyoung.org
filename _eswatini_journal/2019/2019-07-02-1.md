Today is the first working day for us. In the morning, everyone gets up early to prepare for breakfast and lunch, which is a delicious sandwich. With an exciting heart, we begin our journey. The scenery is so beautiful that I cannot stop taking photos. At first, I think that all places in eSwatini are near. However, the road is so rugged that I felt dizzy and almost to throw up in two and half hours of driving. Then my classmates told me that in the next 30 days, we have to drive on this kind of road. Fortunately, I bring enough motion sickness drug for next few days.

After we arrived at a school called Bulandzeni, three children came to our bus and open the doors to welcome us. Many children played on the ground. Looking at us, some of them are curious, and some of them are vigorous with brilliant smile on their face. They are so cute that I almost forget most of them live with poverty. Their lunch may be the only meal in a day. However, I didn’t see any sorrow face. They looked so happy as if they have nothing to worry about. When we asked them to sing for us, about twenty children started to sing and dance without hesitation. Meanwhile, we also dance with them though we didn’t know what’s the meaning of the song. 

Today’s mission is to introduce the concepts of brushing teeth, hand washing, tinea capitis, eye care and burning wound care. Thanks for children cup volunteer teacher, they translated English into siswati in a vivid way. It’s pleasure that all children look happy in the whole health education. Hope they can memorize all of them and really put into action. After introduce all of the concepts, we help children cup to do free clinic. Although we don’t have any medical license, we still do our best to finish the program, and hope that they really take medicine on time.
